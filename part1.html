  <h3>How It All Started</h3>
  <p>It all began with love. I loved someone so deeply that it changed the way I saw the world. But sometimes love is not about holding on—it’s about letting go. People often say, “If you truly love someone, you must set them free.” That was my story. I broke my own heart by walking away, not because the love wasn’t real, but because I thought it was the only way.</p>
  <p>That loss shattered me. Suddenly, life didn’t make sense anymore. I couldn’t sleep at night—insomnia ate away at me. Depression wrapped itself around me, and I felt as though I was walking through a fog every single day. My thoughts grew heavier and darker, and I started to question not only myself but also the entire meaning of life.</p>
  <p>But strangely, pain has a way of opening new doors. That heartbreak pushed me to look at the world differently—through what many call the “third eye.” I started seeing layers beneath the surface, sensing that there was something deeper to existence than just living, working, and dying. My mind and soul began to search for answers that everyday life couldn’t provide...</p>

  <h3>Doubt, Research, and a Quiet Miracle</h3>
  <p>My search naturally led me toward religion, though at first I carried only doubt. I didn’t believe blindly—I questioned everything. I looked into different religions one by one. Some faiths revolved around praying to humans, some to idols carved from stone, and none of that made sense to me. How could the Creator of everything be reduced to an object or a human form?</p>
  <p>Then I came to Islam. What I noticed was that, in its essence, it made sense—especially if you separated the pure words of the Qur’an from the confusion of sects and the many hadith, some of which were clearly false or contradictory. I thought to myself: If Islam was practiced purely with the Qur’an at its center, without divisions, without invented restrictions, wouldn’t life be so much better?</p>
  <p>For a long time, I couldn’t understand the Qur’an, not even in English translation. I would read, but the words felt distant, locked away from me. Then something shifted. One day, as I read again, the meanings began to flow into me. Suddenly, I could understand it—not just the language, but the depth, the message, the feeling behind the words. It felt like a miracle, like the Qur’an itself had touched my heart and chosen the moment for me to truly see it.</p>
  <p>That was the beginning of my awakening—not just to religion, but to myself, to life, and to the possibility that there was truth hidden beneath everything I had once doubted.</p>

  <h3>Seeing Through the Illusions</h3>
  <p>As I kept reading the Qur’an, I felt drawn to journal every day. It wasn’t about following a rigid list of rules or restrictions; the message felt much simpler: live with modesty, kindness, awareness, and truth. For the first time, religion didn’t feel like a cage. It felt like guidance, like a mirror showing me the world as it truly is.</p>
  <p>But with this clarity came a strange shift. I started looking at life differently—like I was waking up from a dream. Nothing around me made sense anymore. Why do we live in fear? Why do we let fear take away our confidence, our freedom? I began to see how society is built like a matrix, keeping us distracted, controlled, and limited. Social media felt like a tool to hide truth. Governments felt like machines of lies. Even the food and medicine we are given—processed meals, pharmaceutical pills—seemed less about healing and more about control.</p>
  <p>I questioned everything. Doctors studied for years, yet many of their treatments, like chemotherapy, often did more harm than good. People weren’t dying just from illness but from the “cures” themselves. It was as if humanity was trapped in a prison without realizing it—living, working, consuming, obeying—all while thinking they were free.</p>
  <p>This realization was both painful and liberating. Painful, because I could no longer live blindly as before. Liberating, because I finally understood that awakening is not about comfort—it’s about truth. And once you see, you cannot unsee.</p>


  <h3>Living in Overdrive</h3>
<p>Awareness became both a gift and a burden. My mind never rested; even in my dreams I was active, analyzing, questioning, observing. At first, I was grateful for this heightened state—it felt like a blessing to see life more clearly. But as days went on, it became heavy. Knowing too much drained me. Life started to feel meaningless, almost like a punishment.</p>
<p>I stopped chasing happiness and instead settled for mere satisfaction. Sometimes I felt like I wasn’t even human—just an observer trapped in a body. Questions haunted me: What am I? Why am I here on this earth? I loved being alone, and strangely, I found comfort in sadness. Crying in the dark brought me a sense of security, a calmness I couldn’t find anywhere else. To others that might sound depressing, but as someone who had been broken by heartbreaks, friendship betrayals, and constant misunderstandings, that was the only version of life that made sense to me at the time.</p>

  <h3>The Weight of Empathy</h3>
  <p>Talking to people became a burden. And yet, I couldn’t resist it. My empathy was so intense that I automatically adapted to the style of anyone I spoke with. It wasn’t conscious—I just slipped into their rhythm, their tone, their emotions, without realizing I was losing my own voice in the process.</p>
  <p>One day, I tried to open up to my mom about Islam—not everything, just a small piece of what I believed. Her reply was simple: “We should follow what our forefathers believed.” In that moment, I felt misunderstood and judged. Some people even looked at me as if I was an atheist, when in truth, I was a firm believer of the Qur’an. That judgment silenced me. From then on, I kept my faith to myself, carrying it quietly inside.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, my philosophical and psychological side grew restless. My thoughts never stopped organizing themselves, analyzing every angle. Life began to feel heavier, emptier. Outwardly, I was thankful for every day. Inwardly, I felt like I was only existing.</p>
  
  <h3>Breaking the Fear</h3>
<p>Despite all the heaviness, one realization kept me moving: Why should I fear people? Why should I fear even my parents’ judgment? Just like them, I am living my first and only life here. The only one worth fearing is God.</p>
<p>As a sensitive daughter, my heart would ache every time my parents doubted me or raised their voice. I cried silently at night, never in front of them. My emotions made me retreat into silence for too long, and finding my way back to communication felt impossible. What saved me, strangely enough, was Korean dramas. They showed me stories of people struggling, failing, laughing, moving on. They taught me not to take everything so seriously and to simply live with the flow. Slowly, I began to heal.</p>
<p>I practiced letting go of fear, and over time, I truly removed it. Alongside that, I started thinking about my career. If I had to live this life anyway, why not live it on my terms—traveling, experiencing nature, working in fields I love?</p>

<h3>A Stranger’s Voice</h3>
<p>That’s when I received a simple “Hello” on LinkedIn. He worked in a field I was interested in, so I replied, asked my questions, and he kindly cleared my doubts. His profile looked impressive, but what struck me most was how genuinely he spoke. Our small talk grew into long conversations. Slowly, we began sharing our stories—traumas, breakups, pain.</p>
<p>At first, I held back. But his honesty about his own struggles made mine feel lighter, less isolating. For the first time ever, I took the risk of opening up to a stranger I had never met in person. I even shared my views on Islam. Instead of judging me, he appreciated my honesty. That alone was huge—it gave me courage to keep speaking.</p>
<p>One day, when I told him life felt empty, he said something that pierced straight into my heart:<br>“The meaning of your life is the fact that you are aware. That you realized. That you went through these stages, carried the energy to start and finish, and didn’t give up.”</p>
<p>That sentence melted me. It gave me courage, confidence, and a spark of hope. He became not just a stranger online, but a special person—an emotional connection I was deeply thankful for.</p>

<h3>Becoming Human Again</h3>
<p>After meeting him, I realized something important: I am not a being from another universe. I am just a human and God sent me here to experience the human journey with all its ups and downs.</p>
<p>I began controlling my over-empathy. I stopped shaping myself around others and instead started being myself. I socialized when I wanted, stayed alone when I needed, and balanced my awareness with living in the moment. I learned a hard truth: knowing too much can be both a curse and a blessing. It gives clarity but can strip away emotions like love. Only by taking risks, by stepping into relationships again, can love return to life.</p>
<p>That online friend said to me: “One day, someone will say the words you need to hear. And you will listen.” And he was right. I listened. I opened up. I reconnected with old friends and classmates, and slowly, I let love back in.</p>
<p>This time, it felt different—safe, secure, and steady. For once, my mind felt like it was breathing. I felt human again. I looked healthier, I gained back strength, and life felt warm instead of heavy. Love no longer controlled me, but it enriched me. And I knew one thing for sure: I would never lose myself in love again, nor would I settle for less.</p>
<p>Now, I live aware, but balanced. Awake, but human. Experiencing every instant with gratitude.</p>

<h3>Gentle Falling</h3>
<p>I’m in love again — not the frantic, losing-myself kind, but a quiet, steady kind that lets me to be me. It’s new, warm, and balanced. This love didn’t erase my awareness; it softened it. Instead of overwhelming me, it taught me how to move through life with a lighter heart. I started doing things better — small daily habits, kinder choices, better sleep, healthier food, more presence. Life began to feel…nice. Simple pleasures returned: sunlight on my face, conversations that land, laughter that doesn’t sting. Love pulled me back into living instead of merely surviving.</p>

<h3>What Love Taught Me</h3>
<p>Love showed me why people need one another. Humans are built from emotion; we fill and empty each other. When our emotional tank is full, we thrive; when it’s empty, we harden. Love is both rare and easy — rare because true, steady care is uncommon; easy because the simple act of giving attention and kindness doesn’t require grand gestures. I learned to love myself first, to put healthy boundaries around affection, and to fall in love within limits. Love became a practice, not a surrender.</p>
<p>When I was reading neuroscience and psychology, I was trying to come to terms with the fact that many of these authors—scientists and doctors—believed in love. Some even called it a miracle. At the time, I couldn’t grasp that. Love felt abstract, unreachable. But then, with the right person, something shifted. I began to see life through that lens—where love truly did feel like a miracle. Not because it was perfect, but because it made everything else make sense.</p>

<h3>Reimagining Family and Intimacy</h3>
<p>I used to think I never wanted a family. The world felt too harsh for children; intimacy felt like nothing but lust. I judged it with a logical, detached mind. But this love changed me. I felt the possibility of building something gentle — growing old with someone, traveling together, learning together, raising children with values instead of fear. I realized that intimacy is not only physical; it is care, companionship, and shared growth. What once felt like a liability now felt like a gift I might want to give and receive in the right way.</p>

<h3>Emotions, Humanity, and Meaning</h3>
<p>Being emotional is not weakness — it is our nature. Emotions give color to life. They make us vulnerable and courageous at the same time. I learned that seeing life positively is an active choice: I can treat being human as a blessing rather than only a punishment. Emotional pain taught me lessons; emotional joy reminded me what I’m living for. Knowledge without feeling can become cold. So I let myself feel, to love, to laugh, to grieve — and to heal.</p>

<h3>The Balance I Strive For</h3>
<p>Now I balance awareness with presence. I keep the clarity I gained from my spiritual and intellectual searches, but I no longer let analysis paralyze me. I take risks — to love, to befriend, to travel, to build a life — while holding on to the lessons that kept me safe. I stopped living out of fear and started living out of choice. I don’t settle for less; I also don’t lose myself in everything I love. I am learning to be human, awake, and kind — and that is enough.</p>

<h3>From Loving Death to Living for Today</h3>
<p>There was a time when I loved death. I wanted it to come as soon as possible — I dreamed about it, pictured it, and somehow found comfort in the idea of leaving. When everyone else spoke about their dreams, mine often turned to how I would die. That longing for an end felt like a strange refuge from pain.</p>
<p>But something shifted. I don’t daydream about dying anymore. Instead, I ask myself a different question each morning: If I were to die today, how would I live today? That question changed everything. It didn’t make death vanish from my mind — it simply turned my focus toward life. Now I try to live kindly, honestly, and with intention. I try to treat every day as a small gift: to be present with the people I love, to act ethically, to feel my emotions fully, and to make choices that I won’t regret. Living well became my quiet rebellion against the pull of emptiness.</p>
<p>I still carry the memory of that darker place — it taught me how fragile and how precious life is — but now I choose to spend my time building, feeling, and loving instead of waiting for an end. That choice doesn’t erase pain; it gives it a purpose.</p>

<h3>End of Trauma</h3>
<p>Loving again was the best choice I made this year. For a couple of years I had so many plans about the life I wanted to build, but reality turned out differently. And yet, it’s not bad at all. I don’t overthink anymore, at least not in the old, destructive way. Now I manage my thoughts; I stay in control. Day by day, I feel more human, and I remind myself of that — I am human.</p>
<p>I became busier in a way that feels good. I pour time into the people and things I care about. I’ve cut down on binge-watching — in fact, I watch almost nothing now — and I started eating meals with my family instead of eating alone. It was never about hiding; it was just how I used to cope. But now, being in love with the right person has healed parts of me I thought were gone.</p>
<p>Before, being alone felt like my only comfort. Now, togetherness feels safe and warm. Even small things have shifted. For a couple of years, I carried a trauma around a goodbye kiss with my mom — one day she moved away when I tried to kiss her cheek, and it broke something inside me. But recently I talked it out with her. I explained why I had stopped. And I started kissing her goodbye again. It may seem small, but to me it’s everything.</p>
<p>His love — this gentle, patient love — has made me a better human than I was before. A softer, braver version of myself. I thank Allah for every step of this journey: the pain that woke me up, the searching that deepened me, and the love that healed me.</p>
<p>This is not the end of my story, but it feels like the end of trauma. The beginning of living.</p>
