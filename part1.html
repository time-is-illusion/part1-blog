  <h3>How It All Started</h3>
  <div>
  <p>I began my journey with questions—wondering if there was a deeper way to live, beyond routines and assumptions. Science offered clarity, but I soon realized that facts alone couldn’t explain the feeling of connection, the sense that something greater shapes our existence.</p>

  <p>Curiosity led me to explore different worldviews. I studied texts, translated meanings, and reflected on how belief systems shape perception. Over time, I found value in simplicity—in ideas that encouraged awareness, compassion, and conscious living.</p>

  <p>As I learned, my perspective shifted. I started seeing patterns in society, media, and even health systems—how information is often filtered, and how fear can limit growth. I began journaling, not to find answers, but to observe life with clarity and openness.</p>

  <p>This chapter isn’t about conclusions—it’s about awakening. It’s about realizing that every experience, even the uncomfortable ones, can teach us something. That meaning isn’t given—it’s created through reflection, awareness, and the courage to question.</p>
