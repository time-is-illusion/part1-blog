  <h2>Chapter 2: Searching for Truth</h2>

  <p>After awakening, I couldn’t settle for surface-level answers. I dove into psychology, philosophy, and science—not just to study, but to understand the patterns of life, human behavior, and the mind itself. I questioned everything: the systems we live in, the way governments and media manipulate perception, the illusions of education and societal expectations, even medicine and the so-called solutions it offers.</p>

  <p>During this period, I realized fear shapes most lives—fear of judgment, of failure, of death. Fear had held me back, stolen my confidence, and kept me from experiencing the fullness of life. I began to practice empathy consciously, exploring relationships, emotions, and self-awareness. I learned that love, though illogical, was a powerful force that could teach patience, vulnerability, and joy. I experimented with mindfulness, lucid dreaming, and observing consciousness, understanding that reality is both internal and external, and much of it is shaped by our perception.</p>

  <p>This was a period of deep questioning, intense reflection, and slow dismantling of illusions. I was learning that truth isn’t handed down—it’s discovered, felt, and lived.</p>
