  <main style="max-width:900px;margin:2rem auto;padding:0 1rem;">
    <h2>⭐ Side Effects: The Things They Hide in the Fine Print</h2>
    <p>Ads say: “May cause dizziness, vomiting, liver failure, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, nightmares, and in rare cases… death.” Yet the visuals show smiling people jogging in a park. That’s the pharma aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Side effects aren’t a conspiracy. They happen because when you push one pathway in the body, you accidentally poke ten others.</p>
    <p>Modern medicine: “Let’s shut down this enzyme so pain reduces.”<br>Body: “Cool, but now your stomach lining is angry.”</p>
    <p>Modern medicine: “Let’s reduce inflammation.”<br>Body: “Ok but now your immune system is sleepy.”</p>
    <p>The truth: side effects happen because the body is complex, not because pharma is secretly injecting poison. But the issue is… they market medicines like they’re candy, not powerful chemicals.</p>

    <h2>⭐ Opioids & Antidepressants: The Dark Chapter</h2>
    <p>Pharma once said: “Let’s cure pain by giving everyone ultra-addictive pills.” And boom: the opioid crisis. Millions addicted, families destroyed, companies sued, executives rich.</p>
    <p>Antidepressants help many people — truly. BUT they’re marketed like emotional Wi-Fi boosters. Feeling sad? Pill. Feeling empty? Pill. Feeling tired? Pill. Marriage collapsing? Pill. World a mess? Pill.</p>
    <p>Again — not evil. Just overused because it’s easier to prescribe a chemical than to fix lifestyle, trauma, loneliness, stress, purpose, sleep, and human connection. Modern life creates emotional sickness, and pharma sells emotional band-aids.</p>

    <h2>⭐ Traditional Medicine: The Part Pharma Can’t Patent</h2>
    <p>Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, herbs, acupuncture, meditation, sunlight, turmeric, garlic, ginger, herbal teas, fasting, detox rituals — these exist for thousands of years. Healing was something you did with your lifestyle, not your wallet.</p>
    <p>Traditional medicine is slow, gentle, and holistic. Pharma is fast, aggressive, and targeted. Both have a place. The mistake is choosing one side like a football team.</p>
    <p><strong>Traditional medicine helps:</strong> digestion, immunity, inflammation, mental health, sleep, stress, long-term balance.<br><strong>Modern medicine helps:</strong> emergencies, infections, surgeries, life-threatening conditions, acute problems.<br>Put them together → that’s real healing.</p>

    <h2>⭐ Fasting: The “Reset Button” They Don’t Teach</h2>
    <p>Fasting is NOT a cure for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or major illness. But fasting DOES reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, activate cell repair, support detox pathways, stabilize hormones, improve clarity, strengthen immunity, reset digestion, and give organs a break.</p>
    <p>Healing comes from food, sleep, stress reduction, relationships, sunlight, movement — not just “not eating.” Pharma will never promote fasting. You can’t sell “don’t eat.”</p>

    <h2>⭐ Pharma Marketing Tricks: How They Make Sickness Look Cool</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create new diseases by renaming normal emotions (tired = “chronic energy disorder”).</li>
      <li>Turn symptoms into personality traits (“You’re not lazy, you’re dopamine-deficient!”).</li>
      <li>Convince you you’re broken — broken people buy things.</li>
      <li>Sponsor research that magically supports their product.</li>
      <li>Sell fear, then sell the cure — oldest trick in history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⭐ The Real Awakening: Health Is the System’s Enemy</h2>
    <p>You want to shock Big Pharma? Sleep 8 hours, walk daily, eat real food, manage stress, reduce sugar and alcohol, spend time in nature, build strong relationships, move your body, learn emotional regulation, fast occasionally, relax, laugh, heal your trauma.</p>
    <p>Congratulations. You’ve just reduced 80% of modern diseases. And guess what? No one profits from that.</p>

    <h2>⭐ Final Message for This Page</h2>
    <p>This page is NOT: ❌ anti-medicine ❌ anti-doctor ❌ anti-vaccine ❌ conspiracy ❌ fear-based</p>
    <p>This page IS: ✔ anti-profit-over-people ✔ anti-manipulation ✔ anti-overmedication ✔ pro-awareness ✔ pro-natural healing ✔ pro-lifestyle ✔ pro-honest science</p>
    <p><strong>The goal is simple:</strong> “Take medicine when you need it. Take care of your body so you need it less.” That’s the real freedom.</p>
