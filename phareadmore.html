      <p><em>“Where sickness is profitable, and confusion is the marketing strategy.”</em></p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <main style="max-width:900px;margin:2rem auto;padding:0 1rem;">
    <p>There is healthcare, and then there is the business of healthcare — and these two barely talk to each other. One is supposed to heal you. The other wants you to come back next month with a follow-up appointment and a new prescription.</p>
    <p>Welcome to Big Pharma Land — the place where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>symptoms = money</li>
      <li>fear = sales</li>
      <li>confusion = control</li>
      <li>chronic illness = subscription model</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yep. The Netflix of sickness.</p>

    <h2>⭐ Pharma Isn’t Evil… But It Is Profit-Driven</h2>
    <p>Medicines save lives — antibiotics, insulin, vaccines, surgeries, anesthesia. No argument. But the industry also pushes over-prescriptions, spends more on advertising than research, sponsors media, pays influencers, and turns sickness into an economy.</p>

    <h2>⭐ COVID-19 Wasn’t Just a Virus — It Was a Marketing Masterclass</h2>
    <p>People were scared. Scared people buy things. Scared people trust whoever has the microphone. Pharma companies got record profits, test kits became gold, telehealth exploded, and vaccines were bought in bulk. Fear is the oldest business model on Earth.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The “Forever Patient” Business Model</h2>
    <p>Pharma makes more money when you’re not too sick to die, not too healthy to stop buying, just sick enough to need lifelong meds. Lifelong customers beat one-time cures.</p>

    <h2>⭐ Doctors Are Not the Villains</h2>
    <p>Most doctors genuinely want to help. They’re stuck inside a system shaped by pharma reps, committees, patient demands, and hospital incentives. They’re trained in disease management, not prevention or lifestyle healing.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Natural vs Modern Medicine Fight Is Pointless</h2>
    <p>Modern medicine saves you in emergencies. Traditional practices help long-term. Lifestyle is the real medicine nobody profits from. The goal is not to choose sides, but to stop being controlled by either side.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Real Awakening</h2>
    <p>It’s not “vaccines are fake” or “doctors are evil.” The awakening is realizing: “In a world where sickness is profitable, you must take responsibility for the parts of health nobody profits from — food, movement, sleep, stress, sunlight, community, purpose.”</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Tablet Paradox: Cure Now, Chaos Later</h2>
    <p>A tablet can fix one thing today and quietly create three new problems tomorrow. Painkillers irritate the stomach, antacids weaken digestion, antibiotics wipe gut bacteria, steroids wreck hormones, antidepressants cause withdrawal, blood pressure meds cause fatigue, diabetes meds encourage reliance on pills.</p>
    <p>Medicines are tools, not lifestyles. Pharma treats symptoms. Life treats roots. And nobody profits from root-cause healing.</p>
