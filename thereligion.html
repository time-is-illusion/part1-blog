      <h1>⭐ My Religious Journey — From Confusion to Clarity</h1>
      <p><em>A personal reflection on faith, doubt, and rediscovery.</em></p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <main style="max-width:900px;margin:2rem auto;padding:0 1rem;">
    <p>I didn’t grow up questioning anything. I was a born Muslim, and like most people, I just followed whatever my parents followed. Not because I understood it. Not because I researched it. Just because I didn’t want hell. That was honestly my first “faith.” Not love. Not understanding. Just fear.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Blind Phase — When I Dove Into Islam Without Thinking</h2>
    <p>I drowned myself in preachers, lectures, videos, Islamic talks — for hours. The more I watched, the more confused I became. Every sect claimed THEY had the truth. Every hadith was labeled differently by human scholars. Islam alone didn’t confuse me — humans inside Islam confused me.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Breaking Point — When Nothing Made Sense</h2>
    <p>In college, I studied everything: Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, Atheism, ancient religions, philosophies, science, cosmology, astrophysics, evolution, black holes, consciousness. For a short phase I even thought I had become an atheist. Science explained what happens, but not why, not who created the laws, not where energy comes from.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Shift — Understanding Allah Differently</h2>
    <p>I realized Allah is not a “man in the sky.” Allah = The ultimate source of energy. The One behind every law of physics. The power behind every atom. Suddenly verses made sense. I read the Quran myself, with an open heart, and clarity came. Fear reduced. Confusion faded. Peace grew.</p>

    <h2>⭐ No More Fear-Based Faith</h2>
    <p>I stopped praying out of fear of hell. I stopped performing religion to impress anyone. My du’a became honest. My fear turned into trust. My confusion turned into peace. Islam became simple, balanced, merciful, logical, human, beautiful. The religion wasn’t the problem. The people were.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Link That Helped Me Clarify Things</h2>
    <p>During my research journey, I found a website that helped me understand things more logically and calmly (not mine): <a href="https://www.quran-islam.org/home_(P1).html" target="_blank">Quran-Islam.org</a></p>

    <h2>⭐ Understanding “Islam” Differently</h2>
    <p>Islam literally means submission — but to God alone. Not men. Not scholars. Not sects. Not culture. Just God. The more I studied, the more I humbled myself. The more I learn, the smaller my knowledge becomes. That realization made me softer, less judgmental, more human.</p>

    <h2>⭐ Final Message for My Page</h2>
    <p>My journey isn’t about proving others wrong. It’s about how I questioned, broke, doubted, learned, and rediscovered Islam in the most honest way. I learned that truth doesn’t fear questioning, blind faith isn’t real faith, fear-based worship doesn’t last, Allah wants sincerity not performance, and knowledge is endless — our part is tiny.</p>
    <p>Faith starts with honesty. And that’s where I found mine.</p>
